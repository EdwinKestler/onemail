Some of the features that are apparent from the code include:

Importing emails from the Gmail API and displaying them in a user interface
Using regular expressions to extract plain text content from emails for analysis
Generating an importance score for the email on a scale of 1 to 100 based on the email's content
Suggesting next steps for the email based on its content
